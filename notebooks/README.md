The notebooks in this folder are used to generate intermediate data and to reproduce the figures in the paper:

- "aggregate_data.ipynb" accumulates data for all 392 days, and accumulates the results over small intervals on the day, hour and minute scale. Results are written into "../Data/Cumulative" (if we accumulate in temporal order) or "../Data/RandomisedCumulative" (if we accumulate in a randomised order).

- "model_fitting.ipynb" fits the 8 models for Zipf's law in Table I of the paper and saves the results in the "output" folder. 

- "figures1,2,3and4,5.ipynb" reproduce the figures of the paper. They use the data from the Zenodo repository, data generated by aggregate_data.ipynb, and fitted results from model_fitting.ipynb. Jenson Shannon Divergence data for Figure 5 is reproduced by running "write_JSD_day.py" and "write_JSD_hour.py" files in the "src" folder.

To reproduce all figures, the following steps should be followed:

1) Run the "aggregate_data.ipynb" notebook to generate all the intermediate data sets
2) Run the "model_fitting.ipynb" notebook to generate the Zipf's Law model results
3) Run "write_JSD_day.py" and "write_JSD_hour.py" from the "src" folder to generate the Jensen Shannon Divergence data
4) Run each of the figure notebooks

If you only want to reproduce certain figures, check the header of the corresponsind notebooks for the specific requirements.
