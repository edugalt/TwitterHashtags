# HashtagsOnTwitter

This repository contains the codes used in the manuscript "Scaling laws and dynamics of hashtags on Twitter", by Hongjia H. Chen, Tristram J. Alexander, Diego F.M. Oliveira, and Eduardo G. Altmann, [arXiv:2004.12707](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12707), published in [Chaos special issue on "Dynamics of Social Systems"](https://aip.scitation.org/toc/cha/collection/10.1063/cha.2020.DSS2020.issue-1).

Structure:

* notebooks: Jupyter notebooks reproducing the figures of the paper
* src: source code used in the computations
* Data: raw data of Hashtag frequencies, to be added from [Zenodo.3673744](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3673744) and intermediate data sets computed using codes in this repository.
* outputs: results of computations 

The codes in this repository were written by Hongjia H. Chen, building on previous codes by Eduardo G. Altmann and Martin Gerlach.
